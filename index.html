				I'm Hunter Land, a software developer with a bachelor's degree and 2.5 years of professional experience.
				I love programming and enjoy looking at all the different engineering designs that make up our daily lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				My first job had me doing QA for Intel for their overclocking utility, XTU.
				In my two and a half years there, I found many bugs, wrote even more testing code, migrated/refactored our large codebase for new systems, and played an important role in setting coding and testing standards.
				I was happy with the team and work, but increasing workloads and ever-worsening policies from much higher up forced me (and many co-workers) to quit and search for other work.
			</p>
			<p>
				C/C++ is my most-used and most-liked programming language, but I have also done a lot with C#.
				C/C++ strikes the perfect balance of low-level, fast, and organized while being old enough to be fleshed out while having many libraries available to use.
				For ease of cross-compatability and build-tool preference, I use CMake to set up compilation and dependency resolution.
				For this reason, less is more in the case of CMake files.
				On my personal machines, I use both Linux and Windows, though I greatly prefer Linux as I find the "Unix Philosophy" much more usable than the monolithic Windows.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from software development, I also mess around in related topics.
				Namely, electronics repair and HAM radio operating.
				Additionally, after dealing with too many questionable-at-best mechanics I focused on learning a lot about automobiles and car repair so I could get my truck back up and running (Which I was able to).
				I find clever designs, and thus all forms of enginerring, to be very alluring, so I end up learning a lot of things about very different topics.
